Books (Self-Published on Amazon)

Colour Picker (C++ with wxWidgets)
Simple tool to find RGB Hex Values for any colour.  This is an app I recreate a lot, normally when I find myself doing a lot of editing work.  Saves constantly  searching online for the values I need.

Face Regognition (Python with CV2, NumPY and Face_Recognition)
Proof of Concept (PoC) for what was meant ot be the start of an automatic lock project for Glyndwr University (Now Wrexham University).  The project was abandoned before advanced work took place due to ethical concerns but this PoC is still a good example of how the technology can be used.
